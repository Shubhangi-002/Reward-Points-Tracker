# Reward Points Tracker 

A ReactJS application to track and display customer reward points earned from purchases over a 3-month period.

## Project Objective

A retailer offers a rewards program that provides:
- **2 points** for every dollar spent **over $100**
- **1 point** for every dollar spent **between $50 and $100**

For example:  
A `$120` transaction earns `2 * 20 + 1 * 50 = 90 points`.

This app allows:
- Viewing reward points per customer by month and in total.
- Filtering by month/year.
- Viewing individual transactions with reward breakdown.
- Paginated view for large datasets.
- Loading, error handling, logging, and unit tests.
